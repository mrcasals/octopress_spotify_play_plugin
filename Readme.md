This Octopress plugin is pretty simple. You have to use the `spotify` liquid
tag and, as param, one of the following examples. 

In the next release it will let you specify the height and the width of the
widget. I hope it won't take very long :)

## Installation
Just download this file into your Octopress installation's `plugins/` directory
and you'll be fine.
