This Octopress plugin is pretty simple. You have to use the `spotify` liquid
tag and, as param, one of the examples you'll find in [the blog post where I
talk about the
plugin](http://mrcasals.github.com/blog/2012/04/11/my-first-octopress-plugin-spotify-play-button/).

In the next release it will let you specify the height and the width of the
widget. I hope it won't take very long :)

## Installation
Just download the `spotify_play.rb` file into your Octopress installation's
`plugins/` directory and you'll be fine.
